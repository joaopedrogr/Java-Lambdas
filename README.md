# Java Lambdas 

## üìò Description
The Java-Lambdas repository provides an in-depth exploration of lambda expressions and functional programming in Java. This repository is ideal for developers who want to master Java's functional capabilities through practical examples and exercises.

Key topics covered:

- Lambda Expressions: Learn the syntax and use cases of lambda expressions.
- Functional Interfaces: Understand the core functional interfaces in Java.
- Method References: Explore how method references simplify code.
- Streams and Functional Programming: Work with Java Streams for data processing.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure
The project is organized for easy learning and experimentation:

### Main Files
### src/
This folder contains Java source code covering key functional programming concepts:

- Calculo.java: Defines a functional interface for mathematical operations.
- CalculoTeste1.java - CalculoTeste3.java: Demonstrate lambda usage in different scenarios.
- Consumidor.java: Demonstrates the Consumer functional interface.
- Fornecedor.java: Explores the Supplier functional interface.
- Funcao.java: Implements the Function interface for transformations.
- OperadorBinario.java: Showcases the BinaryOperator interface.
- OperadorUnario.java: Demonstrates UnaryOperator for single input transformations.
- Predicado.java: Uses the Predicate interface for condition-based logic.
- PredicadoComposicao.java: Demonstrates Predicate composition for complex conditions.
- Multiplicar.java: Implements a lambda-based multiplication operation.
- Foreach.java: Demonstrates iteration using lambdas and forEach.
- Desafio.java: A coding challenge to apply functional programming concepts.
- Produto.java: Explores functional transformations on object attributes.
